Treat array's null terminator specially?
	Create a custom return code to signal wraparound (or end of string?).
	Of course, rethink this.

Test return values in CircularBuffer Set and Get



Figure out dependencies: copy doesn't get detected by makefile but save does.  ? It might be a timestamp thing....

Consider using aliases to simplify the top level makefile:
	makep <MAKECMDGOALS>

Move compiler, include, and linker flags up to the launcher?

Is there any way to have the tests compile the production library without the test includes?
We might need to move this to its own library.


Changes to header files need to cause a rebuild....

Consider where we should put object files. Should all projects depend on the same library objects? Probably. That's why they're in a library, right? So we want obj in the root directory. Tests also all depend on the same obj directory, so let's stick with keeping obj there.
Unless you think of something else. Think it through again when you're all done.

Not all modules depend on mockHw... go back and edit module_configs.

Make the test clean module-specific.

Fix up the help menus!!

callocs can silently fail...

Assertions that dynamic interface pointers are non-null are untested.
Add Array_VerifyBufferIntegrity()
I don't have a consistent place for null checks. The interfaces don't implement them but instead depend on the higher level for implementing it?
Or is it better to implement them at the low level? Hmmm.

Change array size to s16.

Support negative array indices! :)

Set Array pointers to NULL after free? We should checktheir value after free is called.

Have Array handle the null terminator.
